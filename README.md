# CS452 Project Repository

Welcome to the `cs452` project repository! This repository contains data and analysis scripts related to the performance and demographics of academics in Turkey. The analyses cover various aspects such as academic performance, gender comparisons, and institutional evaluations.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following files and directories:

### Jupyter Notebooks

- **`Academics_List.ipynb`**: Generates or processes a list of academics.
- **`NamingMatching.ipynb`**: Handles matching or standardizing names across datasets.
- **`data_merger.ipynb`**: Merges multiple datasets for analysis.

### Directories

- **`Academics_Performance/`**: Contains analysis related to the performance of individual academics.
- **`FacultyPerformance/`**: Focuses on the performance of faculties within universities.
- **`GenderPerformance/`**: Compares performance metrics based on gender.
- **`University_Performances/`**: Analyzes the performance of universities.
- **`Vakif_Devlet_Comparison/`**: Compares private (vakıf) and state (devlet) universities.

### Data

- **`Türkiye Akademisyen Dataları.7z`**: A compressed file containing data on Turkish academics. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to use this dataset.
